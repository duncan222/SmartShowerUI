# Smart Shower User Interface: 
This project was to implement a user interface based on the concept of a smart shower. It still has some work to be done, however, the concept was that of an interface that allows the user to change the tempreture of the water via a touch screen dial, play music from youtube or spotify (not fully implemented, as the apps displayed are actually just decoys), potentially connect their personal devices to it via bluetooth (not implemented), change the shower head type, save/load user settings, and view the weather.

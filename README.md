# Smart Shower User Interface: 
This project was to implement a user interface based on the concept of a smart shower using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It still has some work to be done, however, the concept was that of an interface which allows the user to change the waters temperature via a touch screen dial, play music from youtube or spotify (not fully implemented, as the apps displayed are actually just decoys), potentially connect their personal devices to it via bluetooth (not implemented), view the weather, change the shower head type (rain, mist, etc.), and save/load personal user settings.
